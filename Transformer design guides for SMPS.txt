Transformer design guides for SMPS

Reasons for audible noise 
	-> First of all the transformer should be varnished to remove the possibility of physical movement.
		-due to magnetic pulse pizeo magnetic materials tend to change their shape generating audible noise

	-> Prime candidates are ceramic or magnetic devices.
		- Ceramic capacitors that undergo high dv/dt swings often 
		   prove to be audibly noisy.

	-> Long core transformers also tend to resonate more audibally than those of short core length, where possible, consider
 	    changing to an  alternative shorter core. 


	-> Replace the ceramic capacitors with film capacitors.

	-> Avoid using feromagnetic materials.

	 -> Fix the operating switch frequency
		- Try to avoid the switch frequency in the rangeof audible noise bandwidth. 

	-> Could be an effect of Pulse Bunching.

Reasons for limited current
	-> Core saturation. 
			- Calculate the area needed for the minimum magnetic flux.
